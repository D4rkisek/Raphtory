# What is Doc Brown? ü•º

Doc Brown is the Rust prototype for the next version of [Raphtory](https://github.com/Raphtory/Raphtory), rethinking several aspects of the underlying graph model and algorithm API. 

Please checkout the [issues](https://github.com/Raphtory/docbrown/issues) for the core features to be included in this version, along with their proposed semantics. 

Below is a diagram of how Doc Brown works:

</p>

GraphDB has 4 shards (or partitions) labelled as S1, S2, S3, S4. Shards contain a piece of a graph. Altogether they make up the entire temporal graph, hence the name "TemporalGraphPart" for each shard.

# Running Doc Brown üë®üèº‚Äçüî¨

However, here is a quick start guide if you would like to test out the Raphtory Rust prototype.

## Running the LOTR example üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust installed on your OS. Here is a guide to install [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html). 

### 1. Set up Doc Brown 
Clone the Doc Brown Repository and find the examples directory where you can find the Lord of the Rings Example. Create a folder named "Data" under `examples/lotr` and download the LOTR CSV data into this folder. You can download the raw csv [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raphtory/Data/main/lotr.csv).

### 2. Run Doc Brown

Build Doc Brown by running this command to make sure it compiles and builds:
```
cargo build
```
Next run the main function in `main.rs` which creates a graph from the LOTR csv file, showing the different character interactions throughout the book. To do this, you will need to be in the `lotr` folder, the file path to this from root is `./examples/src/bin/lotr`. Once you are here run this command to run the LOTR example:

```
cargo run --bin lotr
```

You should see output that looks something like this with information about the edges and vertices below: 

```
Loaded graph from encoded data files ./examples/src/bin/lotr/data/graphdb.bincode with 139 vertices, 701 edges which took 0 seconds

Gandalf exists = true
```

Congratulations, you have run your first Raphtory graph in Rust!

### 3. Running Tests

To run tests in Doc Brown, go back into your root folder and run this command:
```
cargo test
```

## How to contribute

Since Doc Brown is still a prototype, we are open to any contributions. If you find any issues or would like to work on some issues yourself, visit the [issues](https://github.com/Raphtory/docbrown/issues) page. Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/raphtory/shared_invite/zt-xbebws9j-VgPIFRleJFJBwmpf81tvxA) if you're having any issues or would like to find out more about how you can get stuck in with Raphtory.
